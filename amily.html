              ‘Amily’ is a virtual travel service for those who lost their imagination in Covid-19 era. <br>
              Through COVID-19, we lost our possibility to travel around the world. Just as Emily Dickinson, stayed in a small room, but traveled the whole world by a book, the virtual travel service ‘Amily’ once again provides opportunities for people to travel through mobile screens to fulfill their imagination. Recapture the coincidence and novelty you could encounter through travel.

            <p class="semiTitle">BACKGROUND</p>
            <p class="context">Emily Dickinson spent nearly 40 years reading and writing poems without going out of the house. Inspired by Her words that compared books to travel that even the poor can do, we suggest a new source of imagination. <br>With the development of modern technology, we were able to travel around the world, face new things, and express our lost imagination in our daily lives. However, through COVID-19, fantasy opportunities have disappeared. We're just looking out the window as if we're trapped in a bird cage. <br>Just as Emily Dickinson, stayed in a small room, but traveled the whole world by a book, the virtual travel service 'Amily' once again provides opportunities for people to travel through mobile screens to fulfill their imagination. Recapture the coincidence and novelty you could encounter through travel.
