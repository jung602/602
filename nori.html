                Traditional games allow children to develop basic social skills.
                They develop sociality by playing traditional games with friends, become creative by discovering new tools and using playground spaces, and learn self-control by following game rules.
                <br>For the next generation of children to overcome the loss of play rights due to COVID-19, we propose a new online playground where they can play traditional games with their friends, make their own game space and rules.

            <p class="semiTitle">BACKGROUND</p>
            <p class="context"> After COVID-19, children were deprived of play rights and stayed home alone. Their playtime was shortened, and their social score was dropped.</p>

            <p class="semiTitle">CONCEPT</p>
            <p class="context">Children develop sociality by playing games with friends, become creative by discovering new tools and using playground spaces, and learn self-control by following game rules.
                For the next generation, we propose a new online playground where they can communicate with their friends through video, build playground spaces, and use a simple block interface to make their own game rules.</p>
